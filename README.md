This repository gives programs to randomy generating binary trees.
Programs are given in two languages
  1. In Haskell, as running prototypes
  2. In Python, for measering performances.
# Motzkin
Motzkin.hs is a Haskell program for linear random generation of Motzkin trees.

MotzkinNonRec.py is a non recursive Python program for "linear" random generation of Motzkin trees, proviso an oracle

# Remy
Remy.hs is a Haskell program for Rémy's  algorithm

Remy.py is a Python program  linear for random generation of binary trees

# Schröder
Schröder.hs is a Haskell for linear for random generation of Schröder trees.

Schroeder.py is a Python program  linear random generation of Schröder trees.


A paper describing these algorithms exists as a draft. It is called Hol_Lin_Gen.pdf
