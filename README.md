This repository gives programs to randomy generating binary trees.
Programs are given in two languages
  1. In Haskell, as running prototypes
  2. In Python, for measering performances.
# Motzkin
Motzkin.hs is a Haskell program for linear random generation of Motzkin trees.
Motzkin.py is a Python program  linear random generation of Motzkin trees (under development)
# Remy
Remy.hs is a Haskell program for Rémy's  algorithm
Remy.py is a Python program  linear random generation of binary trees
# Schröder
Schröder.hs is a Haskell for linear random generation of Schröder trees.
Schroeder.py is a Python program  linear random generation of Schröder trees

A paper describing these algorithms exists as a draft. It is called Hol_Lin_Gen.pdf
